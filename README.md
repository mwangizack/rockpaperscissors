#Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game played by two people. The game consists of each player forming one of three shapes with their hand, representing either a rock (fist), paper (flat hand), or scissors (index and middle fingers extended). The players then simultaneously reveal their chosen shape, and the winner is determined according to a set of rules:

Rock beats scissors (rock smashes scissors)
Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)
Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and played again. The game is often used as a way to make a decision between two options or as a simple form of competition.
